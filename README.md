# document_storage_cli

To Run:
1. Navigate to this directory in terminal
2. enter "node cli.js"

Things I would improve if I had more time:

1. There would probably be weird behavior if you tried moving a filepath that has duplicate values such as
path/path/path as the move command checks for a matching name, but doesn't define any rules around depth.

It works for the test case given in the prompt though.
